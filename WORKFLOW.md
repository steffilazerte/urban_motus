# Workflow

## Order of operations

Ideally we filter as much as we can as early as we can.
However some filters require particular types of data which we can't omit if we want to use them.
For example, we need to resolve ambiguous detections before we omit non-relevant species, so we have
the information we need.

- Filter noisy data
- Ambiguous tags
- Species of interest
- Receivers ?
  - Or do we leave this in so we have better filters at later stages for assessing speed on migration etc.
  
Do we check for complete and accurate metadata (or just filter out problems)?
- If using projects of people involved who would like to know about problems, then yes?
- If we plan to use many different projects and can't / don't want to chase everyone down, then no?
